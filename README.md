# JAVA-Assessment---StudentGen-project

This is my imperfect solution on StudentGen Project.

## Reflection:

### What did I like about this project? 
After 3 days of heavy reviewing and studying the code, I realized I don't understand JAVA at all.

This assessment give me a good shake-up on how much knowledge I lack, even with the help of our lecturer, Jean. This actually motivated and pushed me to pick up another full time JAVA course to master it as my major programming language before any other, in order to journey into Data Science space. 


### What did I struggle with in this project?
1. The main stuggle is 9 days on a heavy JAVA OOP concepts is way not enough. 

2. With the lack of strong JavaScript foundation, weakness in logic thinking, after load of video revision, re-revision, tons of online searching, still struggle to string everything together to complete an error free program.


### What would make the experience with this assessment better?
In my opinion, the assessment should only come with UML diagram and documented with questions. 

This would make the assessment more engaging and interesting which allow trainee to build a complete project from bottom up over the weekends then followed up with a code-along tutorials video or instrctor's demo of full solution to empower remembering concepts.

Advantage: This may helps build new programming language learning momentum and at the same time improve trainees logic thinking without interruption like jumping screen with different topics during lessons especially useful for visual learner like me.

Disadvantage: Somw trainee may not follow and skip doing the code-along section which will defeat the purpose of assessment.
